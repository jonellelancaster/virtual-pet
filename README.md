#WELCOME TO VIRTUAL BABY
_________________________

With the virtual baby program, I began by building out tests in VirtualBabyTest. I decided I wanted to first create getters for my objects. Once those tests ran great, I then 
began creating and testing my methods that were going to be used throughout my program. Once I had created the methods, I then began creating my VirtualBabyApp. I found that 
this was easier since when creating my tests, I had a pretty good idea of how i wanted the program to function. I did run into an issue at first due to the fact that I created 
a for loop to run the majority of my Main method. I settled into a while loop to run the main and the issue of using an for loop with a set number of rotations into an infinite 
loop. I am excited to move forward and add to this program.
