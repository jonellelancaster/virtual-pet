WELCOME TO VIRTUAL BABY
_________________________

With the virtual baby program, I began by building out tests in VirtualBabyTest. I decided I wanted to first create getters for my objects. Once those tests ran great, I then 
began creating and testing my methods that were going to be used throughout my program. Once I had created the methods, I then began creating my VirtualBabyApp. I found that 
this was easier since when creating my tests, I had a pretty good idea of how i wanted the program to function. I did run into an issue at first due to the fact that I created 
a for loop to run the majority of my Main method. I settled into a while loop to run the main and the issue of using an for loop with a set number of rotations into an infinite 
loop. I am excited to move forward and add to this program. 

The Virtual Baby starts with a greeting and then proceeds to call the printmenu method. This will give the player a menu of options to control what happens in the app. 
Depending on which they choose the status of the baby will change. Everytime the user chooses an option, the tick method is also called. This represents time passing and changes the 
status of the baby as well. The goal of the program is to keep the baby above zero in all areas. If any of the status numbers drop below zero, the if statement is called to declare death. 
This if method will also be called if all of the numbers together drop below 25 and inform the user the baby is only half alive. Another feature is the parental  mental status. This is the only instance 
variable that is able to drop below zero. As a parent myself, there are plenty of times I am running at -20 trying to keep my two little humans alive. So parents have a glass of wine and watch your
mental status increase!
